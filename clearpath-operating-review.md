title: Clearpath Operating Review (Simulated)
---

## Context
Clearpath is a simulated behavioral health provider with four programs (PHP, IOP, Outpatient, MAT). I built an FP&A model and an operating review deck to demonstrate driver based forecasting, scenario planning, and variance bridges.

## Executive narrative
- Revenue missed budget due to volume and mix headwinds; cost discipline limited EBITDA erosion.
- Volume shortfall was driven by admissions and show rate.
- Rate and mix pressure reduced blended reimbursement.
- Cost favorability partially offset the revenue miss.
